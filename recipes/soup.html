        <p>In this vegetarian hot and sour soup, you won’t miss the meat, as hot and sour soup already traditionally 
            gets umami from vegetarian ingredients like dried shiitake mushrooms</p>
        <h3>Ingerdients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Broth: Veg / Chicken</li>
            <li>Mushrooms: wood ear & Shiitake</li>
            <li>Green Onions</li>
            <li>Pepper & Salt</li>
            <li>Bamboo Shoot</li>
            <li>Green Chilies</li>
            <li>Rice Vingear, Soy Sauce, Chili ginger Sauce, Ground Ginger -- flavors the Broth</li>
            <li>Toasted Sesame Oil</li>
            <li>Chili Flakes</li>
            <li>Firm Tofu</li>
            <li>Corn Starch</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Start with soaking the wood ears, and shiitake mushrooms in 1 cup of hot water each for 1 hour, 
                until hydrated. Reserve the shiitake mushroom soaking water</li>
            <li>Roughly chop the wood ears, and thinly slice the shiitake mushrooms. Cut the spiced tofu into 
                thin 2 inch-long slices. Cut the tofu into ¼ inch thick pieces, also about 2 inches long </li>
            <li>Add the stock and strained mushroom soaking water to a large soup pot, and bring to a boil. Add the salt, 
                sugar, dried chili pepper (if using), white pepper, soy sauce, and toasted sesame oil</li>
            <li>wood ears, shiitake mushrooms, and bamboo shoots. Bring the soup to a simmer, and stir in the 
                spiced tofu, firm tofu, and vinegar</li>
            <li>Combine the cornstarch with ¼ cup water to make a slurry. Ensure its 
                well-combined, as the cornstarch tends to settle to the bottom of the bowl</li>
            <li>Bring the mixture to a simmer and use your soup ladle to stir the soup in a steady circular
                motion to make a whirlpool while slowly drizzling in the cornstarch slurry. This prevents 
                the cornstarch from clumping. Simmer for another 30 seconds to thicken</li>
            <li>Taste the soup and adjust seasonings to your preference. Add more white pepper if 
                you like it spicier. You can also add more vinegar, soy sauce, or salt</li>
            <li>With the soup simmering/bubbling lightly, stir the soup in a circular motion once again, add the scallions, 
                and serve</li>

        </ol>
